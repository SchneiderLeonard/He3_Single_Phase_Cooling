# He3_Single_Phase_Cooling
Single phase cooling of He3 in extension to the phase change

Still one of my first projects, which could result in a confusing resporitory.

This program calculates the tube length of the heat exchanger at different cases and values. Said HEX is infront (cooling in gaseous state) and after (cooling in liquid state) the dual phase heat exchanger of the earlier project.
It is written to check T. Okamura's results further.
